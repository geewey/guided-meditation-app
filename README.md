# Meditation App Readme

Introducing a web application to calm your mind, body, spirit, and coding-fingers.

# Motivations:

1. Both of us are passionate about mindfulness; we were inspired by the top applications and wanted to learn how to replicate their functionalities.

2. We wanted to build a full-stack project, so we chose to build a Ruby on Rails back-end with a JavaScript front-end.

3. We decided not to use any frameworks as to practice writing clean code for DOM manipulation; the front-end is written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Loading instructions:

1. Fork, then clone/download a copy of the repository to your computer

2. Open the repository in a code editor

3. Navigate to the **meditation-app-backend** folder using `cd meditation-app-backend`

4. Run `bundle install` to install the gems

5. Run `rails s` to start up the Rails server

6. Open another instance of a terminal window, then navigate to the **meditation-app-frontend** folder using `cd ../meditation-app-frontend`

7. Fire up the web application using `open index.html`

8. **Enjoy!**
